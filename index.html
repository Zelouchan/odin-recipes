            <h1>Cooking Basics</h1>
        
                <h3>Good Equipment Is Everything</h3>
                    <p>Sharp knives will make all the cutting you need to do a lot easier, 
                    and a halfway decent non-stick pan will give you a beautfull colour on your steak. 
                    There is no need to buy the most expensive of everything, as long as you do not buy the cheapest option available you are good.
                    Here are some things i suggest you invest in before you start your cooking adventure.</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>Chef's Knife</li>
                    <li>Non-Stick pan</li>
                    <li>Saucepan</li>
                    <li>Colander or Strainer</li>
                    <li>Whisk and Stirring Spoons</li>
                    <li>Hand Mixer</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Prep is Everything</h3>
                    <p>Doing your cutting while you have already started cooking is the worst idea.
                    Take a little extra time before you turn on the stove to make sure that all the ingredients are cut and measures.
                    French people call it <em>mise an place</em> but I just call it good practice.
                    Cutting your unions while your meat is already browning is asking for overcooked meat and uneven unions.
                    If you have the time to cut your vegetables you can make sure that they are all the same size, allowing them to cook evenly.
                    No need for fancy prep bowls, any old take-out container will do.</p>
        
                <h3>Fat is Flavour</h3>
                    <p>We all want to eat healthy, but at what cost? Don't substitute butter if you can help it.
                    Extra lean meat will dry out quickly and just not taste as nice as the more fatty stuff.
                    </p>
