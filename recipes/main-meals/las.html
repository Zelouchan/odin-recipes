        <h2>What you need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300 gram of minced meat, non of that low fat stuff</li>
            <li>A jar of pasta sauce, 400 grams should be a good amount</li>
            <li>3-5 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 Onion, also chopped</li>
            <li>Vegetables, go nuts. I have not yet met a vegetable that does not go well in a lasagna. I am personally found of peppers, spinach and mushrooms. Just make sure it is chopped up</li>
            <li>Dried lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>Italian spices and salt</li>
            <li>Cheese. Don't limit yourself here, cheese you measure with your heart, not a scale. If you are not cheese person, a medium cheddar is a perfect choice.</li>
            <li>Big Oven Dish</li>
            <li>Frying Pan</li>
            <li>Oven</li>
            <li>Aluminum Foil</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>What to do?</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>The step before all steps, pre-heat your oven to 200 degrees celcius. It can take between 10 and 20 minutes for your oven to heat up.</li>
            <li>As the oven is heating up, prepare your ingredients, make sure you have everything measured out, cut up and ready to use.</li>
            <li>First we brown the onions in our frying pan. Put it on medium and leave it there. Good things take time.</li>
            <li>Once the onions are soft and glassy looking we can add the finely chopped garlic. Stir well, this stuff burns fast.</li>
            <li>Push the onions and garlic to the side and put in the minced meat. Push it flat in the pan and leave it for a bit. We want it to turn brown before we move it.
                The brown is the natural sugar of the meat caramilizing and making it extra tasty.</li>
            <li>Once the meat is no longer raw put in your assortment of vegetables.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring for about 15 minutes. Throw in the pasta sauce, salt, and spices.</li>
            <li>It might look very soupy, that is fine. We the lasagna sheets will absorb the liquid while it cooks. Make sure everything is hot but not cooking.</li>
            <li>It is time to start building the layers. A big serving spoon works well. Put a thin layer of sauce and cover it by the pasta sheets. Make sure the sheets do not overlap.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process untill you are out of sheets/sauce or space. Make sure to <em>finish</em> with a layer of sauce.</li>
            <li>This is the most crucial part. Put the cheese on top of the Lasagna. Cover everything. <strong>Everything.</strong></li>
            <li>Cover the whole thing with aluminum foild and slide it in the oven.</li>
            <li>Cook it for 20 minutes with the aluminum foil on top, remove the foil and cook for 20 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Now comes the hard part. The lasagna looks crispy and ready to eat. But the truth it, it needs a little rest. Give it 10-15 minutes to cool and the excess liquid to be soaked up by the pasta.</li>
            <li>That's it! Cut, serve and enjoy.</li>

        </ol>


        <h3>Extra info</h3>
