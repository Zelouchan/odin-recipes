        <h2>What you need:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 roll of pre-made puff pastry</li>
            <li>100 gram Sugar</li>
            <li>25-40 grams of Cinnamon powder</li>
            <li>Baking Sheet with Baking Paper</li>
            <li>Oven</li>
            <li>knife</li>
        </ul> 


        <h2>What to do?</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>The step before all steps, pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees celcius. It can take between 10 and 20 minutes for your oven to heat up.</li>
            <li>As the oven is heating up, prepare your ingredients, make sure you have everything measured out and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Your puff pastry might be a little hard to use when it is still cold, don't worry, when it gets to room temperature it will get easier to use.</li>
            <li>Roll out the puff pastry on a flat, clean surface</li>
            <li>Mix the sugar and cinnamon well with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Spread the sugar and cinnamon mixture over the dough. Make sure that you leave about 3 centimeters at the bottom empty.</li>
            <li>Starting from the top, roll up the dough with the sugar mixture inside.</li>
            <li>Using a bit of water, wet the bottom of the dough to seal it shut.</li>
            <li>Using a big, sharp knife, but the big roll into even pieces, about 2cm thick.</li>
            <li>Place the rolls on the baking paper, swirl side up. Make sure to leave a little space between the rolls.</li>
            <li>That was most of the hard work! Put them in oven once it has reached the right temperature.</li>
            <li>Bake them for 18-20 minutes. You want them to be nice and golden brown, pay special attention that the inside is also done cooking.</li>
            <li>Leave them too cool, It is incredibly tempting to eat them right away, but you will burn your mouth!</li>

        </ol>


        <h3>Extra info</h3>
        <p>Don't let outher people tell you that you are cheating by using pre-made puff pastry.
        It is a pain to make, and we are looking for easy treats, not problems.<br>
        You can use whatever kind of suger you like, as long as it is not sugar cubes. Try and experiment, each type of sugar might get you a different flavour.
