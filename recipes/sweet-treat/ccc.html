            <li>120 gram butter that has been outside of the fridge for an hour or so</li>

            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>180 gram self raising flour</li>
            <li>150 gram chocolate chips</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt></li>
            <li>Baking Sheet with Baking Paper</li>
            <li>Oven</li>
            <li>Mixer and mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Measuring tools</li>
            <li>And ice-cream scoop is handy but you can do without</li>
        </ul></div>


        <h2 class="title">What to do?</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>The step before all steps, pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees celcius. It can take between 10 and 20 minutes for your oven to heat up.</li>
            <li>As the oven is heating up, prepare your ingredients, make sure you have everything measured out and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Put the soft butter and sugar into the mixing bowl and mix untill it is soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract and mix it some more.</li>
            <li>Put in the flour, but do not use the mixer right away. Use a spoon to mix it for a bit untill you are sure you won't get a big poof of flour.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and choclate chips and mix untill everything is well combined.</li>
            <li>Using an ice cream scoop, or normal spoons if you don't have one, place scoops of the dough on your tray. Make sure to leave space for the cookie to flatten.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. You want the to be cripsy on the outside but still soft in the middle.</li>
            <li>Leave them too cool, It is incredibly tempting to eat them right away, but you will burn your mouth!</li>

        </ol>


        <h3 class="title">Extra info</h3>
        <p>Don't let the recipe limit you, experiment with differnt types of chocolate and sugar to get different textures and flavours.<br>
        If you are extra adventurous you might even try to throw in a handfull of steelcut oats (a personal favourite) or some finely chopped dried fruits.<br>
        Want to be extra fancy? Sprinkle some coarse sea salt on top!
